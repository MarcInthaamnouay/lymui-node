## Test it locally

If you want to test it locally please clone this repo and follow the steps below

- go to lymui folder
- Run ```make lib```
- go back at the root of the project
- run ```npm install```. This should compile the binding with the lymui library (static)
- run ```npm run test```

## Npm

This is a WIP. I need to consider building the lib for every kind of platform :) and how should i do
